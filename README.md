# Caesar Ciphers

> In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

The above is an explanation of a Caesar Cipher, courtesy [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).

In this repo, you will find programs that take a string - be it a letter, word, sentence, or a pile of gibberish written using the Latin alphabet - and a positive/negative shift values. They will in turn give you your coded/decoded string. All the programs in this repo carry out the same basic function but are written in different programming languages as a personal practice project.

## Languages the program has been written in so far
1. JavaScript
2. Ruby
3. CoffeeScript (No compilers/transpilers used)
